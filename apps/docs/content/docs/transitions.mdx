### What is a transition?

A transition is a safe mechanism for changing your application's state from one valid state to another valid state when those changes involve asynchronous operations. It ensures data consistency throughout the entire process.

## How transitions work

Transitions work similarly to database transactions: either all changes are applied successfully, or all changes are discarded if anything fails, preventing inconsistent states.

Here's what happens when you fire a transition:

1. When you dispatch an action with a transition property, Saphyra creates a "fork" of your current state
2. All changes (`set` calls) are applied to this forked state
3. Once all operations succeed (no errors or rejected promises), all changes are atomically merged back into the original state
4. If any error occurs or any promise is rejected, all changes are discarded and no changes are applied to the original state

> This design preserves the consistency of your application's state by ensuring that no intermediate states are committed and no inconsistent states are created.
