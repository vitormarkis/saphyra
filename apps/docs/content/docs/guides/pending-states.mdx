description: Learn how Saphyra handles pending states.

## Principles

### Motivation

- One of Saphyra's core principles is to reduce boilerplate and overhead when managing state.
- A common challenge developers face with async operations is deriving pending states.
- Most developers don't derive pending states, they imperatively set state to `true` when an async operation starts and `false` when it ends.
- This approach is not a derivation and is prone to errors.

### Solution

- When you dispatch an action, it may trigger async operations (via the async() module).
- When this happens, you need to pass a transition to the action.
- All pending async operations will be assigned to this transition.
- This allows us to track how many pending operations are running for a specific transition, such as `["like-post"]`.
- If there's at least one async operation running for the transition `["like-post"]`, we know there's a pending state for that transition.
- We provide a hook called [`useTransition`](/docs/exports/create-store-utils#usetransition) to read this information, which is available in the [`createStoreUtils`](/docs/exports/create-store-utils) function.

**Important read: [what is transition](/docs/transitions)**

## Example

```tsx
const newSocialMediaStore = newStoreDef({
  reducer({ state, set, diff, async, deps, action }) {
    if (action.type === "like-post") {
      async()
        .onFinish(revalidate())
        .promise(async ({ signal }) => {
          await deps.likePost(action.postId, signal)
        })
    }

    return state
  },
})

const SocialMedia = createStoreUtils<typeof newSocialMediaStore>()

function Post({ post }) {
  const [socialMedia] = SocialMedia.useStore()
  const isPending = SocialMedia.useTransition(["post", post.id, "like"])

  return (
    <button
      disabled={isPending}
      onClick={() =>
        socialMedia.dispatch({
          type: "like-post",
          postId: post.id,
          transition: ["post", post.id, "like"],
        })
      }
    >
    {isPending ? "Pending..." : "Like"}
  </button>
  )
}
```
